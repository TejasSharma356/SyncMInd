## ✨ What is SyncMind?

SyncMind is an **AI-powered meeting assistant** that works silently in the background. While you focus on the conversation, SyncMind captures key moments, detects action items, flags risks, and delivers real-time insights — all through a sleek, non-intrusive floating UI.

> **🚧 This is the frontend web dashboard.** A standalone desktop application is currently under development and will integrate with this platform for a complete end-to-end experience.
